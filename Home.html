    <h2>About Hyderabad</h2>
    <p>
      Hyderabad (Urban) District in its present shape has come into existence in August 1978, consequent to the formation of a new District, Ranga Reddy, from the erstwhile Hyderabad District. All the rural areas of the erstwhile Hyderabad District have been included in Ranga Reddy District, while the area of the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (excluding a small part), Secunderabad Cantonment, Lalaguda, and Osmania University are included in Hyderabad District. There are 64 villages in the District grouped into erstwhile talukas, namely Charminar, Golconda, Musheerabad, and Secunderabad.

      Hyderabad is the capital of one of the most techno-savvy states in India, Telangana. Previously known as Bagyanagaram, this city is also called the "City of Pearls" due to its prominent pearl trading. Hyderabad was founded in 1591 and planned as a grid with the Charminar at its center. Over the years, it has grown significantly beyond the original walled city to include a new town north of the Musi River, the Military Cantonment at Secunderabad, and a high-tech estate popularly known as “Cyberabad.”
